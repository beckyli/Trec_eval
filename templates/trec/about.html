		TREC stands for Text Retrieval Conference and is focuses on different 
		Information Retrieval methodologies. Essentially, it allows different
		ideas on fast Information Retrieval techniques to be collected and used
		to aid future research.

		Through TREC EVAL, you can view the current standings on who has contributed
		towards these different research areas, known as tracks. The aim is to 
		raise awareness of what TREC is and so this app allows everyone
		to see how different areas of research in Information Retrieval are advancing.
